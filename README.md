# snippets

Just some random snippets/scripts that I want to keep in a repo.

To see a list of scripts, run `npm run`.

## Convert jquery-release changelog

Converts a changelog generated by the jquery-release repo into readable HTML.

```sh
$ cat /path/to/changelog.txt | ./convert-changelog.js > new-changelog.txt
```

## coffee2ot

Convert a CoffeeScript project to something close to OpenTable's ES2015 syntax.

This uses the coffeescript module, [lebab](https://github.com/mohebifar/lebab),
and a bunch of regex replaces (not the most stable way, but it was the quick and dirty solution).

```sh
$ npm run coffee2ot -- "globPattern/**/*.coffee"
```

**Note: quotes are required unless it's one file.**
